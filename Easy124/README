In graph theory, an "edge" is defined as the connection between two vertices. 
Your goal is to sort a given list of edges in the correct connection-order: 
to make your job even easier, given edges will always form one big long line
Lower index integers should be on the left / top of the sorted list, while 
larger index integers should be on the right / bottom of the sorted list. 
All edges are assigned a unique letter to help keep track of ordering.

On standard input, you will first be given an integer, which is the number 
of edges you will then be given. Each given edge is defined by a letter and 
two integers: the letter will always be unique and represents the edge. The 
integers are the actual edge's vertices, and thus may be duplicate (if a 
vertex is shared between two edges).

Simply list the sorted edges from the left-most ordered edge to the right-most 
ordered edge.
